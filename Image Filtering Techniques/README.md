This repository demonstrates various image processing techniques implemented in MATLAB. Below are the main methods covered in the code:

**High-Pass Filter:**
This filter removes low-frequency components and highlights high-frequency details like edges. A kernel is defined and applied in the frequency domain to filter the image.
**Low-Pass Filter:**
This filter smooths an image by removing high-frequency noise and details. The image is filtered by a simple averaging kernel.
**Laplacian Filter:**
This filter detects edges by computing the second derivative of the image. It highlights regions with rapid intensity change.
**Median Filtering (Denoising):**
A median filter is applied to reduce salt-and-pepper noise in the image, making it useful for image denoising.
**Weighted Average:**
This technique combines two images using different weight factors to create a weighted average image.
