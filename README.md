## Image Transformation Techniques

This section covers fundamental image transformations including:
- **Image Negation**
- **Window Transformation**
- **Logarithmic Transformation**
- **Power Law Transformation**
- **RGB to Grayscale Conversion**
- **Image Merging**
- **Change Image Format**
- **Basic Mathematical Operations**
- **Image Subtraction**
- **Adding Pixel Values**
- **Up-Sampling**
- **Down-Sampling**
- **Distance Transform**
- **Bits Per Pixel Adjustment**

## Image Segmentation

This process involves partitioning an image into multiple segments, often using thresholding or edge detection techniques. The code typically utilizes methods like the Canny edge detector or thresholding.

## Basic Image Display and Figure Creation

This section includes scripts for displaying images, creating figures, and handling various data types in MATLAB.

## Image Format Conversion and Resizing

Scripts in this section demonstrate:
- Change Image Format
- Resize the Image
- Convert RGB to Grayscale
- Convert Grayscale to RGB

## Filtering Techniques

This repository demonstrates various filtering techniques, including:
- **High-Pass Filter**: Removes low-frequency components and highlights edges.
- **Low-Pass Filter**: Smooths an image by removing high-frequency noise.
- **Laplacian Filter**: Detects edges by computing the second derivative.
- **Median Filtering (Denoising)**: Reduces salt-and-pepper noise.
- **Weighted Average**: Combines two images using different weight factors.

## Histogram Equalization

This code performs histogram equalization on an input image to enhance its contrast through several steps:
1. Read and Convert the Image
2. Compute the Histogram
3. Normalize the Histogram
4. Calculate the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
5. Perform Histogram Equalization
6. Create the Equalized Image
7. Compute the Histogram of the Equalized Image
8. Display Results

## Edge and Corner Detection

This section focuses on implementing several techniques for edge and corner detection:
- **Canny Edge Detection**
- **Sobel Filter**
- **Roberts Edge Detection**
- **Prewitt Edge Detection**
- **Corner Detection**
